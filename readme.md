## Welcome to my Github!

My name is Griffin Paier and I'm a Data Analyst with a focus on methodology and Economics. I have a B.A. in Quantitative Economics from Loyola University Maryland and recently completed a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through the University of Connecticut's School of Engineering.

Most of my applications hosted on Github were created during my time at UConn's coding bootcamp, and primarily utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, MySQL/Sequelize, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, and React, among other technologies.

### Highlighted Projects

- :sunrise_over_mountains: [Trek Gambit](https://github.com/gmpaier/Trek-Gambit) - My final collaborative project during UConn bootcamp. A social media site with a focus on sharing experiences from and reviewing National Parks. My role for this project was mainly concerned with back end, database management, and routing of API calls. New features slated for development include more leaderboard options and a head-to-head park comparison game!

- :ship: [Battleship](https://github.com/gmpaier/Battleship) - Collaborative project I was the lead on. Allows two users to play the classic boardgame "battleship" over the application on seperate devices. This application was created without learning how to have two users directly communicate; instead, one user will post their move to a central database, and the opponent checks the database for updates until it is their turn. *Unstable deployment!* Currently updating project in my free time using [Socket IO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) to provide true direct user connection. See my progress at [Battleship-IO](https://github.com/gmpaier/battleship-io).

### About Me

- :closed_book: I'm an avid reader of philosophy, I especially enjoy metaphysics and philosophy of language. My personal favorite philosopher is Jacques Derrida.

- :guitar: I love listening to and learning about music. I'll memorize trivia about my favorite artists and producers. Sometimes I even make my own music; maybe someday I'll let someone hear it!

- :dart: My favorite form of entertainment are games, whether it be board games, video games, or athletics. Most recently, I was a member of the New Haven dart league. With my background in Economics and Game Theory, there's even cross over between my professional and recreational interests.
